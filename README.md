 Induction Program 2025 – GNDEC

### Date 31 July, 2025 
### Day 1
##  A Peaceful Beginning at the College Gurdwara Sahib

The day began on a deeply peaceful and reflective note. At **8:30 a.m.**, all newly admitted students gathered at the **College Gurdwara Sahib** for a soul-touching *Shabad Kirtan*.  

As soon as we stepped into the Gurdwara, a sense of calm enveloped us – from the white marble floors and elegant domes to the soft hum of sacred hymns. It was more than a ritual; it was a beautiful welcome into the next chapter of our lives.

What made the experience even more special was the **structure of the Gurdwara Sahib** itself. From inside, the ceiling and interior resembled a **ship**, symbolizing a spiritual journey. It felt as though we had boarded **Waheguru’s Jahaz** (ship) together – a divine start before our academic voyage.
