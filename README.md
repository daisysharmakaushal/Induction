 Induction Program 2025 – GNDEC

### Date 31 July, 2025 
### Day 1
##  A Peaceful Beginning at the College Gurdwara Sahib

The day began on a deeply peaceful and reflective note. At **8:30 a.m.**, all newly admitted students gathered at the **College Gurdwara Sahib** for a soul-touching *Shabad Kirtan*.  

As soon as we stepped into the Gurdwara, a sense of calm enveloped us – from the white marble floors and elegant domes to the soft hum of sacred hymns. It was more than a ritual; it was a beautiful welcome into the next chapter of our lives.

What made the experience even more special was the **structure of the Gurdwara Sahib** itself. From inside, the ceiling and interior resembled a **ship**, symbolizing a spiritual journey. It felt as though we had boarded **Waheguru’s Jahaz** (ship) together – a divine start before our academic voyage.

# Day 2 Experience – First-Year CSE/IT Student

Second day as CSE and IT students was a good mix of tests, useful sessions, and real interactions. The schedule helped us get more comfortable with college life and understand what to expect moving forward.

The day started with the **English Proficiency Test**. Each section had its own classroom — for example:
- CSE-A: Room F-106  
- CSE-B: Room F-107  
(and so on)

The test checked  basic grammar, vocabulary, and reading skills. It wasn’t too difficult and gave us an idea of where we stand in terms of language understanding.

## Interaction with Seniors & GitHub Intro

The last part of the day was an interaction with our **seniors**, and it really stood out.

They were super friendly and made us feel welcome. They also gave us an **intro to GitHub** — a platform where coders share and manage their code.

### What We Learned:
- How to make a GitHub account
- What a repository is!

They also said not to stress if we don’t get everything at once — we’ll learn as we go. Their support really made us feel like part of the department.
